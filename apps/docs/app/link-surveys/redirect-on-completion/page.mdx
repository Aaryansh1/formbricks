# Redirect on survey completion

Automatically redirect users to a specified URL upon completing a survey. Enhance user flow and engagement by seamlessly guiding respondents to the next step. There are two ways of achieving it:

1. Static Url Redirection
2. Dynamic Url Redirection

## **Staic Url Redirection**

This is usefull when you want to redirect all the survey respondents to the same url.

### **Steps to Set Up Staic Url Redirection**

1. **Open Settings in Survey Editor**: Navigate to your survey in the survey editor where you wish to enable redirection (make sure its a link survey)
2. **Select Response Options**: Find and select **`Response Options`** to access settings related to survey responses.
   <MdxImage
     src={StepOne}
     alt="Choose Response option"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />
3. **Enable Redirect on completion**: Find the option for **`Redirect on completion`** and activate it. You will be prompted
   to enter a url to which respondents would be redirected to.
   <MdxImage
     src={StepTwo}
     alt="Choose Redirect on Completion"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

## **Dynamic Url Redirection**

This is usefull when you want to redirect different respondents to different Urls

### **Steps to Set Up Dynamic Url Redirection**

1. **Append redirectUrl param to survey link**: Before sending the survey link to the respondent, append **`redirectUrl=<you-redirect-url-here>`** to the survey link

   <MdxImage
     src={RedirectUrlExample}
     alt="Redirect Url example"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl "
   />

<Note>
  In cases where both static and dynamic redirect URLs are configured, dynamic redirect URL would be given a
  higher priority
